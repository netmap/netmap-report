\section{Conclusion}
\label{ss:conclusion}
In this paper, we present \name{}, a system that
provides a battery-aware network performance
measurement collection service with a simple API for
mobile devices. \name{} is easy to integrate, unobstrusive,
cheat-proof, and data-hungry. The measurement library
collects more than 200 types of network metrics and is
both battery and network aware. Preliminary results
have demonstrated that it is possible to assist both
researchers and normal users to better understand the
network performance with \name{}'s data.
