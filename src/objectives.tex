\subsection{Design Objectives}

Our main objectives when designing NetMap are as follows:

\textbf{Easy to integrate.} The popularity of the NetMap platform will be
inversely proportional to the cost of integrating it in a game, so we focused
our energy on reducing the surface area of the NetMap interface, and reducing
the amount of specialized knowledge require to understand it.

\textbf{Unobtrusive.} Collecting and processing the network measurement data
should not adversely impact game performance. On mobile devices, the biggest
constraints are battery life, the bandwidth and latency of the wireless
Internet connection, and the data cap (quota) of the Internet connection.

\textbf{Cheat-proof.} Any popular game has players who attempt to cheat, and
the most common way of cheating in location-based games is supplying a fake
location to the system. NetMap should detect measurements that are likely to
contain fake location data, and should discard data supplied by cheating
players.

\textbf{Data-hungry.} To facilitate future analysis that we haven't thought
about, NetMap should collect as much network-related data as is reasonably
possible. During every measurement, we collect all the additional data that
does not impose additional burdens on the user's battery life or network
connection.
