\label{s:abstract}

We introduce a platform for measuring wireless Internet access performance
across the world's cellular and WiFi networks. Our platform consists of a
library for collecting network performance measurements on Android devices, a
pipeline for storing and processing the performance measurements, and tools and
sample code for accelerating the development of location-based mobile games
that contribute peformance measurements to our project. We plan to develop one
such game, and release it for free on the Android market. Players pay for the
by game by implicitly allowing us to use their phone to measure network
performance. We also opened up and documented our platform, hoping to influence
other (more talented) game developers to build games on top of our platform.
