\subsection{Measurements}
We measure more than 200 types of network data, including device-specific data such as device model and location (GPS), network performance data including latency, bandwidth, and average round-trip-time, neighboring network infrastructure information such as neighboring network type and signal strength to neighboring towers/access points, and the DHCP information. All the measurements are stored in json, so that we can easily parse and do analysis on the data afterwards.


{\bfseries Device-Specific Information.} We collect device-specific information including the device ID 
(IMEI or ESN), the device type (GSM or CDMA), and the software version, etc. With the device ID, we can 
uniquely identify a device, track the device, and discard bad data that comes due to cheating. We can 
even provide personalized detailed network using habit or network performance feedback data to the user. 
The software version allows us to infer the effect of the software on the network performance. We also 
log information about the SIM card, such as the phone number, the SIM card operator (AT\&T, T-Mobile, etc.),
the 

{\bfseries Neighboring Network Infrastructure Information.} \name{} collects information about
neighboring WiFi APs and cell towers. 

 

{\bfseries Network Performance.} We collect sophisticated network performance measurements between the device
and servers, such as the network latency, bandwidth, average round-trip-time, and some TCP variables. These
measurements are crucial for both network researchers and device users. For researchers, 


For the network performance data, we use the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT), which measures various network 
performance metrics between the mobile device and their distributed servers. There are some straightforward 
and incredibly tedious problems in measuring the network performance. First, one needs to consider the time 
synchronization problem between the device and the server; second, to eliminate the noise in the measurement, 
one needs to maintain servers in multiple places. NDT solves the time synchronization problem, and it maintains 9 servers in the US.
